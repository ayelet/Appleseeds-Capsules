# AppleseedsCapsules - Weekend project

This weekend project is all about: API calls, CRUD, js, CSS styling etc. - This is a wrapup project that sums the js session
Plans:  1. Design General Structure of project - 1 hour
        2. Write & Debug the CRUD side of the app - 2 hours
        3. Write & Debug the UI - 4-5 hours (hopefully less)
        4. Write the CSS part - 2 hours
        5. Test the app using jest - 2 hours
        6. Design UI - 1 hour
Process is "agile" - design, write, debug => redesign, rewrite, test
